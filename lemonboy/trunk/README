
Lemonboy2x, a Gameboy/Gameboy Color emulator for Gp2x

= Motivation =

Gnuboy by K-teto is great for Gameboy and Gameboy color emulation, but its
interface is absolutely different from any other emulator. In 2006, K-teto
worked on a new version of Gnuboy with art by Madcore that was codenamed
'lemon', and then he lost the source files. A few years later, I glue
together the bits of code that K-teto saved and the terrific Madcore graphics
to create a version of Gnuboy with this enhancements:

 - Solves some Gnuboy2x bugs: long lists, zip files support.
 - More intuitive menu
 - Configurable palettes
 - More flexible frame support
 - Additional video modes
 - Super Gameboy support

= Usage =

Unzip in any directory of the SD and place roms (GB, GBC or ZIP that stores
only a single rom file) in the 'roms' directory. Run lemonboy2x.gpe and
enjoy.

If you want to use frames in the unscaled video setting, a RGB-PNG
image in the 'frames' directory. The recommended size is 320x240, but you can
use any image size. Remember to leave a central region of 160x144 for the
Gameboy screen. Frames are not used in the scaled modes.

GB and GBC games could use palettes/filters to modify on screen colors. Copy
palettes (GB) and filters (GBC) in the directory 'palettes' See the CONFIG
file for the format of these files.

The default distribution includes some example frames and palettes/filters.

== Compilation ==

In the src directory:

make: compiles the PC SDL version with lots debugging information
make -f Makefile.gp2x: compiles the Gp2x version with minimal lib support
make -f Makefile.gp2x.sdl: compiles the Gp2x version with SDL support
make dist: compiles every version and creates a distributable zip

== Buttons ==

Buttons in the menu:

A/B: accept
X: cancel
UP/DOWN: move up/down one item
L/R: move up/down ten items (one page)
RIGHT/LEFT: change an item, if possible
SELECT in the rom list: show/hide the preview box, if available

Buttons during game (configurable, see CONFIG):

START:	Start
SELECT:	Select
B	Gameboy A button
X	Gameboy B button
Hold A	Change video mode
Y	Show menu
L	Save state in slot 0
R	Load state from slot 0
Vol+/-	Change volume

== Compatibility with Gnuboy ==

You can use the games that were saved with Gnuboy in Lemonboy2x. Copy files
in Gnuboy's 'sram' directory into Lemonboy's 'saves', changing the suffix
.X.srm to .sav. For example, if your rom is named "mygame.gb", Gnuboy saved
the ram state in "gnuboy2x/sram/myname.gb.srm" and it should be copied as
"lemonboy2x/saves/mygame.sav"

Since this is the first version of an emulator from Gnuboy for any platform
with Super Gameboy support, states saved in Super Gameboy mode won't work on
any other Gnuboy emulator. In-game saves (.srm files) should work fine.

Frames in Gnuboy were 320x240 BMP files, and you should convert to RGB PNG to
use them in Lemonboy2x.

== Configuration files ==

Lemonboy reads "etc/system.gp2x" only once at the beginning of the execution.
When you load the rom "mygame.zip", Lemonboy reads "configs/default.rc"
and then "configs/mygame.rc". The format of these files is specified in
CONFIG, but they are simple ASCII texts that can be edited with any text
editor.

There are lots of configurable things in this emulator, including in-game
buttons or emulated system. Many of them are not configurable throught the
options menu, since you'll only need to set them once. The following lines
are only a quick summary, read the CONFIG file for in depth configuration. 

There are several settings that you should only modify in "etc/system.gp2x"

- set previews true/false: switch on/off the preview box
- set romdir "/path/to/roms": set the path to the roms, if not 'roms'
- set confirmsave true/false: confirm save state
- set confirmload true/false: confirm load state
- set subdirectories on/off: switch on/off the support for subdirectories

There are several setting that you can modify in any configuration file by
hand, but it seems more useful in the per-game rc files:

- set samplerate 44100: the sample rate for the sound. 44100 is the
  default, maximum quality, but you can gain speed setting the samplerate to
  22050, 11025 or as low as 8000.
- set volumen 80: the default volumen of a game, from 0 to 100
- set machine 0/1/2/3: to set Gameboy Color/Advance/SGB1/SGB2

== Super Gameboy ==

This version of Lemonboy has preliminary Super Gameboy support, both SGB1 and
SGB2. Unfortunately, there are some known issues:

- Frames: lemonboy supports custom frames for SGB games. You can save this
  frames in the system menu.
- Palettes: I still have to figure out how palettes work for moving sprites
  and CGB.  Currently, palettes have some problems:
    - They are OK in games such as Donkey Kong II and III, if you include the
      option 'set forcepal0 true'
    - Weird colors for moving sprites in many GB games. A temporal fix is
      using 'set forcepal0 false' for these games. Moving sprites are then
      in Black and White.
    - Very bad support for CGB games, no matter of forcepal0. Do not use SGB
      mode with CGB games.
- There is not support for multiplayer, sound effects or direct access to
  the SNES hardware.

  As you see, only frames work OK. Maybe you'll want to switch SGB mode just
  to save the custom frame, and then restart the game in CGB mode with the
  custom frame.

== Game configurations for performance ==

This version of Lemonboy only has mode 16 bits in Gp2x. I thought that the
mode 8 bits would improve performance, but it doesn't. So I removed the
video mode 8 to clean the source code. Hopefully, you will not notice any
difference.

If frameskip is on, lemonboy will drop some of the frames of the game in
order to gain speed. In this mode you can set down the cpu clock and save
battery. The frameskip algorithm is very subtle and hardly noticeable, and
it is recommended to set it always on.

Gameboy games work ak 60 frames per second (FPS). You can set the FPS display
on in order to check the effect of your configuration changes on speed. Below
60FPS your game is slow, and then you can try to set frameskip on, set mode
8, use "colorful" palette for GBC games (since it does nothing), raise the
clock frequency or low the samplerate, maybe in this order.

Take into account that the SGB mode can run games slower that the other
modes.
